# PhantomPenguin Portfolio

## 🛠️ What is this?

* Built a terminal-style website… because I wasn’t in the mood for buttons and shiny UI.
* I don’t *hate* frontend. I just don't *love* it.
* Backend is my playground — APIs, servers, databases. The stuff that makes things work but never gets the applause.

---

## 😑 Mobile Users: Yeah, sorry.

* This site **doesn’t work on mobile**.
* Why? Because ASCII art turns into a mess on small screens.
* Could I have fixed it? Sure.
  Did I? Nah. Not a priority right now.

---

## 🤝 Why I built it?

1. To prove I *can* do frontend — I just choose not to.
2. Because if I’m building a portfolio, it better feel like mine — weird, functional, and kinda fun.
3. It's part project, part protest — and maybe still good enough to share on LinkedIn (if you scroll past the “no mobile support” bit).

## 📂 How it works?

* Type `help` — you'll see the list of commands.
* `cat About.txt` — my story, short and honest.
* `cat Projects.txt` — stuff I’ve built. No fluff.
* `cat Contact.txt` — where to find me.

You’ve also got basics like `ls`, `echo`, `date`, etc.
Just enough to feel like you're in a terminal. But not annoying.

---

## 📢 Heads up:

* Not a pixel-perfect portfolio.
* More like, “hey, this works, and it's *me*.”
* Fork it, break it, remix it. It’s open — just don’t turn it into a React landing page, please.

## 🤷‍♂️ Finally…

Not here to impress with gradients or animations.
Here to show that I build things, and this is one of 'em.

If you read till here — you're built different.

– *Fazal*
